# The 'wordpress' group is one we're defining now, which will be used
# to reference all hosts that we should deploy WordPress to.
wordpress:
  # Here we will define the 'hosts' that belong to this group, each of
  # which may be referenced by domain name or IP address.  Only one
  # must be defined, though you may add as many as you want.
  hosts:
    # This is an example of a host, which is commented so that you must
    # review this file and update this section.

    # First we must specify a domain or IP address, so that Ansible
    # knows what host(s) it should run against.
    domain.tld:
      # 'system_user' refers to the Linux system user that the
      # WordPress installation will be owned by and created under this
      # user's '~/doc_root' directory.
      system_user: "wordpress"

      # The domain associated with the WordPress installation.  Simply
      # use the domain name itself without defining a protocol or
      # adding trailing '/' characters.
      site_domain: "domain.tld"

      # The email address of the WordPress admin user
      site_email: "user@domain.tld"

      # The username of the WordPress admin user
      site_user: "example_username"

      # The password of the WordPress admin user
      site_pass: "example_password"

      # This variable controls whether the full InMotion UltraStack
      # should be deployed, which includes the following along with
      # the core LAMP services:
      # - nginx
      # - redis
      #
      # Note that if you have deployed with use_ultrastack set to true
      # and want to set it to false, you _must_ stop and disable the
      # nginx service to free up ports 80 and 443:
      #
      #   systemctl disable --now nginx
      #
      use_ultrastack: true

      # Setting this to 'true' will generate a LetsEncrypt SSL for the
      # target site.  It is safe to enable/disable this feature as
      # needed, and any SSLs that were generated will not be removed
      # to prevent exhausting the 5-per-week limit imposed by
      # LetsEncrypt.
      use_letsencrypt: true
